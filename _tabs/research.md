A rural economy's transformation into an industrialized and service-based economy is known as urbanization. Urban sprawl is an important result of urbanization which occurs when a city's population is scattered over an expanding geographic region. In the 20th century, the process of urbanization has spread throughout the world. Because urban areas experience greater horizontal expansion than vertical expansion, the growth of the city is typically more apparent in its periphery. The population of rural areas with primary activity moves to urban areas with secondary and tertiary sectors as a result of this horizontal expansion. India is a nation that is largely urbanizing, which has 461 million people living in urban areas. This number is rising by 2.3% annually and urban infrastructure needs to be built, which is a difficult task. Tamil Nadu is the tenth largest state and it ranks third on the urban population. Tiruppur city is one of the developing urban area and textile hubs of Tamil Nadu. Urbanization is rapid in this city and should be assessed for strong and sustainable growth. Satellite images for 3 different years have been taken and Land Use / Land Cover map is prepared to analyse the change in land use category. Also, it helps to find about the sprawl direction and measures can be taken according to that in future. Also, the Urban Expansion Intensity Index (UEII) was calculated to evaluate the rate and speed of urban growth, gives a clear view of the city expansion during the study period.
