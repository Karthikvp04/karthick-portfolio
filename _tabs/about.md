I am a geographer from the Nilgiris mountains, a place that inspired my interest in landscapes, environment, and the relationship between people and nature. Growing up in such an ecologically rich region shaped my curiosity about how places change over time.

My interests include urban studies, climate studies, wildlife management, and environmental management. I am particularly interested in understanding how cities grow, how climate influences regions, and how we can manage natural resources more sustainably.

I have practical experience working with GIS and geospatial software for mapping and spatial analysis. I have also worked with remote sensing techniques, satellite data, and environmental datasets to study land use, environmental change, and spatial patterns.

I enjoy using geospatial tools to better understand real-world problems and to support sustainable planning and conservation efforts.
